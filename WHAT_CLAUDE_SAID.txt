The full CalSol Inventory Tracker application has been built. Here's a summary of everything created:

**Backend (AWS Lambda + DynamoDB via SAM)**
- `template.yaml` — AWS SAM IaC defining 6 DynamoDB tables, 20+ Lambda functions, and API Gateway with CORS
- `backend/lambdas/shared/utils.py` — JWT auth middleware (`@require_auth`, `@require_write`), response helpers
- `scripts/build.sh` — distributes shared utils to all Lambda packages before deploy
- Lambda functions for: Auth (Google OAuth login, me, list users, update user), Cars (CRUD), Parts (list, get, create, update, replace, delete, history, custom fields), Miles (log + get), Reports (high miles, MBF, likely-to-fail), Upload (xlsx/csv bulk import)
